# React Native DateTime

Platform agnostic date & time pickers for React Native.

These are simple implementations written in Typescript that mimic Google Calendars date & time pickers.

This project also includes [NaiveDate](./src/datetime/NaiveDate.ts) & [NaiveTime](./src/datetime/NaiveTime.ts) types which do not include timezone
& can be converted into ES Date type (inheriting local timezone).

> Demos are recorded in GMT+02:00.
